CNN have much superior performance image, speech, or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of layers:

1. Convolution Layer: It is responsible for identification of features using filters and reduces overfitting. It creates feature map by applying filters to the input image.
2. Pooling Layer: Reduces the dimensions of the feature map and reduces computation. Commonly used pooling method is max pooling, it reduces the feature map to a different dimension based on the filter size and the stride value given.
3. Fully Connected Layer
